Rachel	 Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
Rachel	 It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
Rachel	 Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Rachel	 What?!!
Rachel	 Oh, that is so...
Rachel	 Okay, see now, what I just heard blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Rachel	 Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
Rachel	 Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.
Rachel	 Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.
Rachel	 Yeah, you bet.
Rachel	 Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
Rachel	 Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Rachel	 Because, he’s my friend.
Rachel	 Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Rachel	 Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.
Rachel	 I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Rachel	 Really!?
Rachel	 Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Rachel	 I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Rachel	 Funny book?
Rachel	 Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?
Rachel	 I’ve got some bad news.
Rachel	 Hi, sweetie!
Rachel	 Oh.
