Monica	 Uh-huh.
Monica	 Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.
Monica	 Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
Monica	 Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Monica	 Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Monica	 Oh, can I borrow this? My milk’s gone bad.
Monica	 Well so?
Monica	 Okay, well I do know you.
Monica	 Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?
Monica	 So umm, how was your date with Ginger?
Monica	 Hi!
Monica	 No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, ‘the movie star.’
Monica	 Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Monica	 Home is Home Star stew.
Monica	 We’d love too.
Monica	 Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Monica	 Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.
Monica	 Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Monica	 Yeah, sure.
Monica	 Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Monica	 Look at you. All jealous.
Monica	 Hey.
Monica	 No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
Monica	 Yeah, Ginger something.
Monica	 Well, what did you do?
Monica	 Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it’ll be more fun that way.
Monica	 You gave her food poisoning!?
Monica	 Sorry, Pheebs.
